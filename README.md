Giphy API
==================================
This app is used for displaying gifs (this one is Marvel themed) from the Giphy API.
You can search new gifs which generates a new button that you can click to populate those gifs.
Gifs are stored as still images. They can be clicked to be animated and re-clicked to make the images still once more.
